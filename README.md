### For the creation of Borg BackUP GUI (++ the required packages).
Change to the src directory with :

    cd ~/Borg-BackUP-GUI/src/

Create the GUI with it:

    qmake && make
   

### Mount problems?    
The GUI always uses the mount folder during the initial setup. This can be found in ~/Borg-BackUP-GUI/src/mount so that it is present on Github a blank file is needed e.g. ".gitkeep" this file should be deleted in the folder when using this folder.
For e.g. Ubuntu and its derivatives it may be necessary to install the following:

#### Debian (Ubuntu / Linux Mint)
    sudo apt install python3-llfuse

#### Arch Linux (Manjaro / Artix / Antergos)
	sudo pacman -S python-llfuse

### Instructions can be found here: [Guide for beginners](https://github.com/MTrage/Borg-BackUP-GUI/wiki/Short-instruction)

#### If you have any useful changes or improvements, please let me know.
I wish you a lot of fun with BORG BackUP GUI.
