### BORG BackUP GUI can also be used by new Borg users to get to their destination very quickly.

## For the creation of Borg BackUP GUI (++ the required packages).
Change to the src directory with :

    cd ~/Borg-BackUP-GUI/src/

Create the GUI with it:

    qmake && make
    
## Make bin/BORG-BackUP-GUI executable
If you just want to have a quick look at "BORG BackUP GUI" and start the /bin/BORG-BackUP-GUI, you have to make the file executable with:

    chmod +x ~/Borg-BackUP-GUI/BORG-BackUP-GUI


## Mount problems?    
The GUI always uses the mount folder during the initial setup. This can be found in ~/Borg-BackUP-GUI/src/mount so that it is present on Github a blank file is needed e.g. ".gitkeep" this file should be deleted in the folder when using this folder.
For e.g. Ubuntu and its derivatives it may be necessary to install the following:
    sudo apt install python3-llfuse
